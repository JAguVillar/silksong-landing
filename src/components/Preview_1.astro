    <h3>Captured and Taken to a Distant Land</h3>
    <div>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Hornet, princess-protector of Hallownest, finds herself alone in a vast,
        unfamiliar world.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        She must battle foes, seek out allies, and solve mysteries as she
        ascends on a deadly pilgrimage to the kingdomâ€™s peak.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Bound by her lineage and guided by echoes of her past, Hornet will
        adventure through mossy grottos, coral forests and shining citadels to
        unravel a deadly thread that threatens this strange new land.
